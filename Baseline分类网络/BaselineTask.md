>>> `c1 = [i==1 for i in b]
>>> import numpy as np
>>> c1 = np.array(c1)
>>> c1.sum()
>>> 1121
>>> c2 = [i==2 for i in b]`
>>> `c2 = np.array(c2)`
>>> `c2.sum()`
>>> `15237`
>>> `c3 = [i==3 for i in b]
>>> c3 = np.array(c3)
>>> c3.sum()
>>> 21196
>>> c4 = [i==4 for i in b]`
>>> `c4 = np.array(c4)`
>>> `c4.sum()`
>>> `2446`
